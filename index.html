      <p class="description">
        It was July 2019 and we wanted give up with our frenetic city time so we decided to make some videos in the nature.
        We found this beauty place in Pontelagoscuro (Ferrara, Italy) and we build up 2 coreographies
        related to each other following the waves of peace of the nature.
        The exhibitions of these performances, with the crickets chirping sounds, bring all the peace
        of the nature with them, people in the exhibitions starts to feeling love for life and a new
        type of time conception that they maybe have never discovered.
